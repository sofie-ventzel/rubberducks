                <h3 className="mt-10">Where do I start birdwatching?</h3>
                <p>
                    Start wherever you are! Birds are everywhere if you take the time to
                    notice them. Begin by trying gardens, parks, local reserves or woods.
                    Find a spot you know well, ideally somewhere birds are easy to see -
                    with feeders, perhaps. This is where you can get your eye in and
                    become familiar with a good selection of species.

                <h3>How do I find the birds?</h3>
                <p>
                    Use your full range of senses. Your peripheral vision is highly
                    sensitive to movement (an adaptation our ancestors used to detect both
                    predators and prey), so try to tune into what's going on in the
                    corners of your eyes. Listen, too - you'll need to stop moving about
                    to do so properly, though you can hear even the quietest calls if you
                    listen hard enough. Loud bursts of chattering song or clicking calls
                    close by are warnings that birds have seen you - but can you see them?
                </p>

                <h3>How do I learn to identify birds?</h3>
                <p>
                    There's no substitute for experience, so just get out there and
                    practice! Joining an organised session or asking a regular birder to
                    help you is really useful - they will help you see more, and point out
                    important features in real time. This is much more effective and
                    memorable than learning from books or websites, though the latter
                    becomes more useful as your own ability grows. If you're able to take
                    photographs or sound recordings, share them on social media sites and
                    ask for identification help. The majority of people are more than
                    happy to help a beginner get to grips with the different species.

                <h3>What kit do I need?</h3>
                <p>
                    Binoculars not only help you see details you'll need to identify birds
                    - they allow you to enter their world, and see individual feathers
                    shifting as a bird turns its head; the puff of steamy breath as it
                    sings on a cool morning; and the precise movements of beak and claw.
                    Be warned: these exquisite details are how birdwatchers get hooked.
                    Take a notebook and pencil to record your experiences as they happen -
                    don't assume you'll remember everything. You may also wish to buy a
                    field guide such as the tough, waterproof charts for different
                    habitats from the Field Studies Council.

                <h3>When should I go?</h3>
                <p>
                    There's plenty to occupy the birdwatcher in each of the four seasons:
                    spring for newly arrived migrants, peak birdsong, courtship and
                    nesting behaviour; summer for parents and fledglings intent on
                    feeding; autumn for gathering migrants; and winter for intense action
                    around feeding stations, invasions of visitors from further north,
                    late afternoon roosts, vast flocks of waterfowl, and starling
                    murmurations. Birds have daily routines as we do - and these are most
                    predictable at the beginning and the end of the day, so these are
                    usually the best times to watch.{" "}

                <h3>What if I get stuck?</h3>
                <p>
                    Everyone does! If you see a mystery bird, note down as many details as
                    you can including its appearance, song, location and behaviour. If you
                    can take a photo (even if it's not a good one) that will help. Use the
                    information to consult a field guide, share with a local bird group or
                    social media. Don't be afraid to ask questions.

                <h3>How do I use a hide?</h3>
                <p>
                    A hide full of people armed with expensive-looking kit can be
                    intimidating, but don't be put off. Enter and close the door quietly.
                    If you're not sure what birds to expect, look for a log book or board
                    with recent sightings. Find a seat and a window. It's fine to talk
                    quietly, and to ask people what they have seen - most will be happy to
                    share, and to point out when they see something interesting. When it's
                    time to leave, do so quietly, but do add any new sightings to the log.

              <p>
                  When making an entry, the most useful things to record include the
                  species name, the amount of birds of that species, the date and the
                  place. Additional information like the age, the sex, the direction of
                  flight or any curious behavior adds value to the observation.
