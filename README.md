## Future Development

RubberDucks uses Web3Forms but in the future with the right funding we would take this to a server to make the postings more secure

RubberDucks needs to improve searches to include by poster name and by region

RubberDucks could have full time mediators of the data if funding became avaliable and popularity grew
