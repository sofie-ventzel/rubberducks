## User Story

I am an existing bird enthusiast that wants to post my sightings for others to enjoy and be part of an ornithophile community.

I am interested in spotting birds but have never known how to get started or where are the best locations.

## Description

RubberDucks is an idea site for bird enthusiasts to get their daily dose of bird activity.

With posts coming in from all over the UK, you are sure to find remarkable images of both common and rare species.

RubberDucks is community supported, posts come in through our submissions to a mailbox where volunteer moderators check the detail and assist in adding information before committing the post to the site.

This moderation is what makes it so easy for new Bird Enthusiasts to join in as you can request assistance in your post or visit our 1 - 0 - 1 page and give it a go.

## Usage

The site is deployed here: https://keen-cactus-33cc63.netlify.app/

When you deploy or run the application you will see the following site on your browser:

## APIs

Web3forms

YouTube

WikiPedia

## Future Development

RubberDucks uses Web3Forms but in the future with the right funding we would take this to a server to make the postings more secured.

RubberDucks needs to improve searches to include by blogger name and by region.

Our image resolution is a little poor so enhancements here could prove a game changer.

RubberDucks could have full time mediators of the data if funding became available and popularity grew.
