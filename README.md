## User Story

I am an existing bird enthusiast that wants to post my sightings for others to enjoy and be part of an ornithophile community

I am interested in spotting birds but have never known how to get started or where are the best locations

## Description

RubberDucks is an idea site for bird enthusiasts to get their daily dose of bird activity

With posts coming in from all over the UK, you are sure to find remarakable images of both common and rare species

RubberDucks is community supported, posts come in through our submissions to a mailbox where voluenteer moderators check the detail and assist in adding information before committing the post to the site

This moderation is what makes it so easy for new Bird Enthusiasts to join in as you can request assistance in your post or visit our 1 - 0 - 1 page and give it a go

## Future Development

RubberDucks uses Web3Forms but in the future with the right funding we would take this to a server to make the postings more secured

RubberDucks needs to improve searches to include by blogger name and by region

Our image resolution is a little poor so enhancements here could prove a game changer

RubberDucks could have full time mediators of the data if funding became avaliable and popularity grew
